/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict, role-based access control (RBAC) model centered around administrators.
 * A user's admin status is the primary factor for granting write permissions across the database.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is designed to be highly performant and secure. Admin status is determined by the
 * existence of a document in the `/roles_admin` collection, where the document ID matches the user's
 * UID. This avoids slow and costly `get()` calls in other rules. Data is segregated into distinct
 * top-level collections for public content and admin-only management.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /billboards/{billboardId}: A public collection containing billboard information, readable by anyone.
 * - /roles_admin/{adminId}: A private collection where document existence signifies admin privileges.
 * - /admin_users/{adminUserId}: A private collection storing profile data for administrators.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public vs. Private Data: Billboards are public-read, but all write operations are restricted to admins.
 * - Admin Management: Only existing administrators can view, add, or remove other administrators. This prevents privilege escalation.
 * - Default Deny: All access is denied by default and only explicitly granted through these rules.
